Are you getting Income Support while either:

- getting [Statutory Sick Pay](/statutory-sick-pay/)
- incapable of work, but being treated as capable of work because you are temporarily disqualified from receiving Income Support




  * too_ill_to_work: I’m getting Statutory Sick Pay
  * temporarily_incapable_of_work: I’m incapable of work, but being treated as capable of work because I’m temporarily disqualified from receiving Income Support
